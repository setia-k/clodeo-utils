# Test Todo
Not every function have a test case. Due to at least one of the following reasons:
  * Some functions are too complex to test or untestable by jest.
  * I don't understand the purpose of the function.
  * Time constraint.
Ideally all functions should have a proper test case.

## Functions that have no test cases
Below are the functions, that have still no test cases:
  * base36Decode
  * base36Encode
  * cartesian
  * downloadFile
  * get
  * parseQuery
  * passwordValidation
  * slugify
  * toQueryString
